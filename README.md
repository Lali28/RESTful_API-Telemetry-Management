# RESTful_API-Telemetry-Management

## Overview

This project involves the development of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) RESTful API for managing telemetry data. The API is designed to track the time saved by automation processes created by *NWU Tech Trends*. The time saved is associated with a cost and is grouped by project and client. The API connects to a SQL Server database, where telemetry data is stored, and provides endpoints to manage this data efficiently.

The API is built using **ASP.NET Core** and follows RESTful principles, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and ease of integration with other systems. The project is hosted on **Azure**, and the API is accessible via a secure endpoint.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: The API supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for telemetry data.
- **Time and Cost Savings Calculation**: The API includes methods to calculate cumulative time and cost savings per project and per client.
- **Database Integration**: The API is connected to a SQL Server database, with Entity Framework Core used for database scaffolding and management.
- **Cloud Hosting**: The API is hosted on Azure, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- **Swagger Documentation**: The API is documented using Swagger, making it easy for developers to understand and use the endpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The API is built using ASP.NET Core, a cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based applications.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used for database scaffolding and management, enabling seamless interaction with the SQL Server database.
- **Azure**: The API is hosted on Azure, leveraging its cloud capabilities for scalability and reliability.
- **Swagger**: Used for API documentation, providing an interactive interface for testing and exploring the API endpoints.
- **GitHub**: The project is version-controlled using GitHub, with regular commits and updates to track progress.

## API Endpoints

Below is a list of the key endpoints implemented in the API:

### Telemetry Management

- **GET /api/telemetry**: Retrieves all telemetry entries from the database.
- **GET /api/telemetry/{id}**: Retrieves a specific telemetry entry based on the provided ID.
- **POST /api/telemetry**: Creates a new telemetry entry in the database.
- **PATCH /api/telemetry/{id}**: Updates an existing telemetry entry based on the provided ID.
- **DELETE /api/telemetry/{id}**: Deletes an existing telemetry entry based on the provided ID.

### Time and Cost Savings Calculation

- **GET /api/telemetry/savings/project/{projectId}**: Calculates the cumulative time and cost savings for a specific project, filtered by a date range.
- **GET /api/telemetry/savings/client/{clientId}**: Calculates the cumulative time and cost savings for a specific client, filtered by a date range.

## How to Use the API

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CMPG-323-Project-2.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Ensure you have SQL Server installed and running.
   - Run the provided SQL script to create the necessary tables in the database.
   - Update the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to connect to your database.

3. **Run the API**:
   - Open the project in Visual Studio 2022.
   - Build and run the project. The API will start and be accessible via the localhost URL provided in the console.

4. **Access Swagger Documentation**:
   - Once the API is running, navigate to the Swagger UI by visiting `https://localhost:<port>/swagger` in your browser.
   - Use the Swagger interface to explore and test the API endpoints.

5. **Deploy to Azure** (Optional):
   - If you wish to host the API on Azure, follow the steps in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-api-management-using-vs?view=aspnetcore-6.0) to publish the API to an Azure API Service.

## Project Structure

- **Controllers**: Contains the API controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Models**: Contains the data models used by the API, including the telemetry model.
- **Data**: Contains the database context and configurations for Entity Framework Core.
- **Migrations**: Contains the database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core.
- **appsettings.json**: Contains configuration settings, including the database connection string.
- **Startup.cs**: Configures the services and middleware used by the API.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Filtering**: Implement more advanced filtering options for retrieving telemetry data.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication to restrict access to certain endpoints.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track API usage and performance.
- **Integration with Other Systems**: Expand the API to integrate with other systems, such as project management tools or client portals.
